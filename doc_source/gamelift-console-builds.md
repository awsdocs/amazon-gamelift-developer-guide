The **Builds** page provides the following summary information for all builds:

  + **Ready** – The build has been successfully received and is ready for fleet creation\.
  + **Failed** – The build timed out before the binaries were received\.
+ **Build name** – Name associated with the uploaded build\. A build name is provided when uploading the build to Amazon GameLift, and can be changed using the AWS SDK action [UpdateBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateBuild.html)\.
+ **Build ID** – Unique ID assigned to the build on upload\.
+ **Version** – Version label associated with the uploaded build\. A build name is provided when uploading the build to Amazon GameLift, and can be changed using the AWS SDK action [UpdateBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateBuild.html)\.
+ **OS** – Operating system that the build runs on\. The build OS determines what operating system is installed on a fleet's instances\.
+ **Size** – Size, in megabytes \(MB\) of the build file uploaded to Amazon GameLift\.
+ **Date created** – Date and time that the build was uploaded to Amazon GameLift\.
+ **Fleets** – Number of fleets currently deployed with this build\.

## Build detail<a name="gamelift-console-builds-detail"></a>

Access a build's detail page from either the console dashboard or the **Builds** page by clicking the build name\. The **Build** detail page displays the same build summary information as the Builds page\. It also shows a list of fleets created with the build\. This list is essentially the fleets catalog, filtered by build\. It includes the same summary information as the [**Fleets** page](gamelift-console-fleets.md)\.
