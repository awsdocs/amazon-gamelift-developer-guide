# Test your integration with GameLift<a name="gamelift_quickstart_test"></a>

GameLift supports fast iteration when testing your game servers\. This topic guides you through the types of testing available\.

**Custom game servers**  
Use GameLift to integrate hardware anywhere in your environment into your GameLift game hosting architecture\. GameLift Anywhere registers your hardware with GameLift in an Anywhere fleet, so that you can test using your own local development computer\. For more information about testing with GameLift Anywhere, see [Test your custom server integration](integration-testing.md)\. For more information about using GameLift Anywhere for hosting your games with on\-premises solutions, see [Choosing GameLift compute resources](gamelift-compute.md)\.

**Realtime Servers**  
With Realtime Servers, you can update your scripts at any time\. When you update a Realtime script, GameLift distributes the new version to your hosting resources within minutes\. After GameLift deploys the new script, all new game sessions use the new script version\. After GameLift deploys the new script, you can begin testing immediately\. For more information about Realtime Servers see, [Integrating games with GameLift Realtime Servers](realtime-intro.md)
