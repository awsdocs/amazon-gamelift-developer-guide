## LogParameters<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-log"></a>

This data type is used to identify which files generated during a game session that you want Amazon GameLift to upload and store once the game session ends\. This information is communicated to the Amazon GameLift service in a [ProcessReady\(\)](integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-processready) call\.

### Contents<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-log-contents"></a>

**logPaths**  
List of directory paths to game server log files you want Amazon GameLift to store for future access\. These files are generated by a server process during each game session; file paths and names are defined in your game server and stored in the root game build directory\. For example, if your game build stores game session logs in a path like `MyGame\sessionlogs\`, then the log path would be `c:\game\MyGame\sessionLogs` \(on a Windows instance\) or `/local/game/MyGame/sessionLogs` \(on a Linux instance\)\.   
Type: List<String>  
Required: No

## DescribePlayerSessionsRequest<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-playersessions"></a>

This data type is used to specify which player session\(s\) to retrieve\. It can be used in several ways: \(1\) provide a PlayerSessionId to request a specific player session; \(2\) provide a GameSessionId to request all player sessions in the specified game session; or \(3\) provide a PlayerId to request all player sessions for the specified player\. For large collections of player sessions, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as sequential pages\.

### Contents<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-playersessions-contents"></a>

**GameSessionId**  
Unique game session identifier\. Use this parameter to request all player sessions for the specified game session\. Game session ID format is as follows: `arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/fleet-<fleet ID>/<ID string>`\. The value of <ID string> is either a custom ID string \(if one was specified when the game session was created\) a generated string\.   
Type: String  
Required: No

**Limit**  
Maximum number of results to return\. Use this parameter with *NextToken* to get results as a set of sequential pages\. If a player session ID is specified, this parameter is ignored\.  
Type: Integer  
Required: No

**NextToken**  
Token indicating the start of the next sequential page of results\. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action\. To specify the start of the result set, do not specify a value\. If a player session ID is specified, this parameter is ignored\.  
Type: String  
Required: No

**PlayerId**  
Unique identifier for a player\. Player IDs are defined by the developer\. See [Generate Player IDs](player-sessions-player-identifiers.md)\.  
Type: String  
Required: No

**PlayerSessionId**  
Unique identifier for a player session\.  
Type: String  
Required: No

**PlayerSessionStatusFilter**  
Player session status to filter results on\. Possible player session statuses include the following:  
+ RESERVED – The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated\.
+ ACTIVE – The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected\.
+ COMPLETED – The player connection has been dropped\.
+ TIMEDOUT – A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the time\-out limit \(60 seconds\)\.
Type: String  
Required: No

## ProcessParameters<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-process"></a>

This data type contains the set of parameters sent to the Amazon GameLift service in a [ProcessReady\(\)](integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-processready) call\.

### Contents<a name="integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-process-contents"></a>

**port**  
Port number the server process will listen on for new player connections\. The value must fall into the port range configured for any fleet deploying this game server build\. This port number is included in game session and player session objects, which game sessions use when connecting to a server process\.   
Type: Integer   
Required: Yes

**logParameters**  
Object with a list of directory paths to game session log files\.   
Type: `Aws::GameLift::Server::[LogParameters](#integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-dataypes-log)`  
Required: Yes

**onStartGameSession**  
Name of callback function that the Amazon GameLift service calls to activate a new game session\. Amazon GameLift calls this function in response to the client request [CreateGameSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateGameSession.html)\. The callback function takes a [GameSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameSession.html) object \(defined in the *Amazon GameLift Service API Reference*\)\.   
Type: `void OnStartGameSessionDelegate(GameSession gameSession)`   
Required: Yes

**onProcessTerminate**  
Name of callback function that the Amazon GameLift service calls to force the server process to shut down\. After calling this function, Amazon GameLift waits five minutes for the server process to shut down and respond with a [ProcessEnding\(\)](integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#integration-server-sdk-csharp-ref-processending) call before it shuts down the server process\.  
Type: `void OnProcessTerminateDelegate()`  
Required: Yes

**onHealthCheck**  
Name of callback function that the Amazon GameLift service calls to request a health status report from the server process\. Amazon GameLift calls this function every 60 seconds\. After calling this function Amazon GameLift waits 60 seconds for a response, and if none is received\. records the server process as unhealthy\.  
Type: `bool OnHealthCheckDelegate()`  
Required: Yes

**onUpdateGameSession**  
Name of callback function that the Amazon GameLift service calls to provide an updated game session object\. Amazon GameLift calls this function once a match backfill request has been processed\. It passes a GameSession object, a status update \(updateReason\), and the match backfill ticketID\.  
Type: `void OnUpdateGameSessionDelegate ( UpdateGameSession updateGameSession )`  
Required: No
