# Onboarding phase checklist<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_prepgameserver_checklist"></a>

Use the following checklists to keep track of onboarding phase items\. Items marked **\[Critical\]** are critical for your production launch\. 
+ **\[Critical\]** Make sure that the game clients \(game executable running on the player machines\) are not making AWS SDK calls directly to Amazon GameLift APIs\. Requests should be authenticated through a backend service\.
+ **\[Critical\]** Make sure that you are carefully managing any keys or secrets that are used by the servers and that a rotation schedule is in place\. Compromised server processes are unlikely, but processes should not have access to the keys directly\. Best practice is to use IAM roles that you provide to GameLift server instances for access to other AWS resources\.
+ **\[Critical\]** For a fault tolerant architecture, plan for a failover to another Region for FlexMatch and queues\. If you preconfigure this multi\-Region setup, the fleets can be destinations on both queues\. In case of a Region\-wide issue, your backend should fail over from one matchmaker to the other automatically\.
+  Plan the roll\-out of fleets to your target Regions, with queue and fleet structure\. A single fleet can have multiple locations spanning across any number of GameLift supported Regions\. Automate the deployment process\. You can use Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK to implement the automation of your deployment\.
+  Build a load test client\. Ideally, automate some level of load testing as well\. Load testing can be done, for example, with a headless version of your game client that mimics player actions\.
+  Perform load testing to see where your API throttles are\. You may be calling the API at a much higher rate than you expect\. 
+  Test your system under gradually increasing loads with alpha, beta, and soft launch tests\. Most sensitive to extremely high loads are the matchmaking, game session placement, and game session creation operations\. Running longer game sessions or reusing game sessions for automated rematching, where possible, improves these dynamics considerably\. For example, 100,000 concurrent users \(CCU\) 1v1 with 1 minute matches creates 833 new games per second \(high\) and 100,000 CCU 4v4 with 4 minute matches and 2X reuse of sessions creates 13 new games per second \(good\)\. Spread game creation between Regions, if possible, if you are expecting very high amounts of traffic\. If you have unavoidably high requirements, contact AWS Support for help\.
+  Collect plenty of data\. Logs and analytics are your best actionable data, so think carefully about what you need to collect and how to effectively manage and analyze that data\. It will drive operational management, design changes, future technical development, business intelligence, customer satisfaction, and product longevity throughout the whole game lifecycle\.
+  If the game servers write logs to Amazon EBS volumes, check that these are eventually deleted \(e\.g\. an hour or so later\), even if they are collected and uploaded by GameLift\. Use a different directory or log file name for each server process and each game session\. GameLift does not manage your log file lifecycle, and logs can exhaust Amazon EBS storage on the instance\. Instances can also be removed at any time, causing you to lose some logs\. To mitigate this, use CloudWatch Logs service, an Elastic Load Balancing stack, or other log aggregation service\. Standardize the log data so that it can be read and understood in context, in real time, and it is easy to set alarms for different failure conditions\.
