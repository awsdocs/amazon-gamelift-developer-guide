# Launch<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_launch_checklist"></a>

Use the following checklists to keep track of launch items\. Items marked **\[Critical\]** are critical for your production launch\.
+ **\[Critical\]** Set the fleet protection policy to full protection on all live fleets so that scaling down doesn't stop active game sessions\.
+ **\[Critical\]** Set fleet maximum sizes sufficiently high to accommodate at least peak anticipated demand\. We recommend that you double your maximum size for unanticipated demand\.
+ Encourage the whole team to participate in the event in a launch room to monitor your game launch\.
+ Monitor player latency and player experience\.
