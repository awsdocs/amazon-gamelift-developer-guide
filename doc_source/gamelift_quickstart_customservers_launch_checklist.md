# Launch<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_launch_checklist"></a>

Use the following checklist to track launch items for your game hosted on GameLift\. Items marked **\[Critical\]** are critical for your production launch\.
+ **\[Critical\]**[ Set the fleet protection policy](fleets-creating-all.md) to full protection on all live fleets so that scaling down doesn't stop active game sessions\.
+ **\[Critical\]** [Set fleet maximum sizes](fleets-capacity-limits.md) high enough to accommodate peak anticipated demand, at minimum\. We recommend that you double your maximum size for unanticipated demand\.
+ Encourage your whole dev team to participate in the launch event and monitor your game launch in a launch room\.
+ Monitor player latency and player experience\.
