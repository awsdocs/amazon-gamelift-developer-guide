# Testing Phase Checklist<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_test_checklist"></a>

Use the following checklists to keep track of testing phase items\. Items marked **\[Critical\]** are critical for your production launch\. 
+ **\[Critical\]** Raise GameLift and other AWS service quotas to ensure that the live environment can scale up to the maximum size, which is at least the sum of the maximum instances for all fleets and fleet locations in the Region\. You should also fill out the launch questionnaire\. It is located in the AWS Management Console under **GameLift**\|**Service Limits**\. If you send it to the address given, it will help the GameLift team better understand your API limit requirements\. 
+ **\[Critical\]** Check that the ports that are open on live fleets match the range of ports that could possibly be used by any server on the fleet instances and are open to 0\.0\.0\.0/0\. For example, if servers listen to ports in the range 38200 to 38300, these must be open to the world\. GameLift service blocks ports 1\-1025\.
+ **\[Critical\]** Check that RDP port 3389 and SSH port 22 are closed or limited to a small address range reflecting the developerâ€™s public IP address range or ranges\. These ports \(and any unused ports\) should not be open to 0\.0\.0\.0/0 under any circumstances\.
+  Make sure that your DevOps team has enough visibility into your system, and effective command and control tools and protocols\. Document what you think could fail, and what protocols and procedures will be used to mitigate the failure\. These protocols and procedures are sometimes referred to as *runbooks*\. Automate the procedures if possible\.
+  Check that the number of servers running on an instance at full usage are within the capabilities of the server instance type\. Also, if there are busy activity periods during non\-core gameplay, like loading a map, check that one or more games loading \(typically no players attached\) does not impact running gameplay sessions\. Decrease process or thread priority from within the game server as necessary during these operations\. You can also limit the number of concurrent game session activations on an instance for a GameLift fleet\.
+  Do not let the fleet scaling policy under\-provision instances\. Tune the scaling policy to be more conservative at first, providing a bit more idle capacity than you think you will need\. You can optimize for cost later\. Consider the use of target\-based scaling policy with 20% idle capacity\.
+  Check that the FlexMatch rules contain a latency rule \(if you are passing latency data\) so that players who are logically close to the same Region typically play together\. Test how this behaves under load with synthetic latency data from your load test client\. If you use latency data in one part of the system, then use it everywhere that it can be used including FlexMatch, game session queues, and backfill requests\. If you do not, the results are undefined\.
+  Make sure that your player authentication and infrastructure that's related to getting players in games \(such as your own custom matchmaking\) can scale effectively to meet demand\. Make sure you load test these backend services as well\.
+  Check that the server, if left running for several days, is still able to accept connections\. For example, leaving a C\# `TcpListener` open for days will eventually stop being able to receive and respond to connections\.
+  If you are using CloudWatch Logs or CloudWatch custom metrics, set CloudWatch alarms for messages indicating severe or fatal problems on the server fleet\. Simulate some failures if practical and test the runbooks\.
+  Check that Spot Instances are typically available for the Regions and instance types you are using\. If, in the spot history graph in the GameLift console, the Spot prices approach the on\-demand price, this is a prime indicator that the Spot Instances will not be available for FleetIQ\.
+  Raise your AWS Support level to business or enterprise level to ensure that AWS can respond to you in the case of problems or outages outside of office hours\. Your account team has no access to your fleets and cannot help you if your servers stop working\. 
+  Create your live environment separate from development on another AWS account\. Check that each queue in use has an on\-demand fleet with locations in all your required Regions that it must serve\. Understand the rules for how queues place games \(which is different depending on whether there is latency data present\) and create your live on\-demand and Spot Fleets accordingly using your final executables\.
+  Practice updates to the live environment servers\. Be clear on your upgrade strategy, and how you will revert if you discover a problem with a new version\. Consider using GameLift aliases instead of fleet IDs in your system\. This is mandatory if you are not using GameLift game session queues\.
+  Validate with a load test that GameLift fleets in your live environment are available and performant\.
+  Validate that the correct group of people have IAM access to the live fleets and other GameLift and AWS resources\. Restrict access of other personnel with IAM policies\.
