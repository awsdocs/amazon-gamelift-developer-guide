# Plan Your Global GameLift Resources Deployment<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_plan"></a>

Use the following tips to help plan your global GameLift resources deployment\.
+ A single Amazon GameLift fleet has a home Region \(the Region you deploy it to\), but it can deploy resources to any number of GameLift supported Regions\. Select Regions based on where your players are located and your latency needs\. For example, a turn\-based game might not have low latency requirements and you could use a single Region per continent where a first\-person shooter requires a very low latency experience and you likely want to use all the Regional locations, especially if your player base is global\.
+ If there are any Regional differences in the matchmaking logic, you will need to deploy your FlexMatch configurations and queues in a single Region for each geographical area of your players\. More commonly, the configurations are the same for all Regions\. GameLift queues have a hard limit of 100 transactions per second, so achieving a higher rate is another reason to host multiple queues\.
+ FlexMatch configurations and queues are Regional resources\. To do cross\-Region failover for fault tolerance, you need to deploy a backup FlexMatch configuration and queue in a separate Region and implement logic in your backend service to fail over in the rare case of Region\-wide issues\.
+ For China, you commonly deploy a completely separate set of resources including fleets, queues, and FlexMatch matchmaking configurations\. This is because connectivity between China and the rest of the world will not in most cases meet your latency and reliability requirements\.
