# Testing your integration<a name="integration-testing-local"></a>

Use GameLift Local to run a limited version of the managed GameLift service on a local device and test your game integration against it\. This tool is useful when doing iterative development on your game integration\. The alternative—uploading each new build to GameLift and configuring a fleet to host your game—can take 30 minutes or more each time\. 

With GameLift Local, you can verify the following:
+ Your game server is correctly integrated with the Server SDK and is properly communicating with the GameLift service to start new game sessions, accept new players, and report health and status\. 
+ Your game client is correctly integrated with the AWS SDK for GameLift and is able to retrieve information on existing game sessions, start new game sessions, join players to games and connect to the game session\.

GameLift Local is a command\-line tool that starts a self\-contained version of the managed GameLift service\. GameLift Local also provides a running event log of server process initialization, health checks, and API calls and responses\. GameLift Local recognizes a subset of the AWS SDK actions for GameLift\. You can make calls from the AWS CLI or from your game client\. All API actions perform locally just as they do in the GameLift web service\.

Each server process should only host a single game session\. The game session is the executable you use to connect to GameLift Local\. When the game session is completed, you should call `GameLiftServerSDK::ProcessEndning` and then exit the process\. When testing locally with GameLift Local, you can start multiple server processes\. Each process will connect to GameLift Local\. You can then create one game session for each server process\. When your game session ends, your game server process should exit\. You must then manually start another server process\. 

GameLift local supports the following APIs:
+ CreateGameSession
+ CreatePlayerSession
+ CreatePlayerSessions
+ DescribeGameSessions
+ DescribePlayerSessions

## Set up GameLift local<a name="integration-testing-local-start"></a>

GameLift Local is provided as an executable `.jar` file bundled with the [Server SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/getting-started/)\. It can be run on Windows or Linux and used with any GameLift\-supported language\.

Before running Local, you must also have the following installed\.
+ A build of the GameLift Server SDK version 3\.1\.5 or higher
+ Java 8 

## Test a game server<a name="integration-testing-local-server"></a>

If you want to test your game server only, you can use the AWS CLI to simulate game client calls to the GameLift Local service\. This verifies that your game server is performing as expected with the following: 
+ The game server launches properly and initializes the GameLift Server SDK\.
+ As part of the launch process, the game server notifies GameLift that the server is ready to host game sessions\.
+ The game server sends health status to GameLift every minute while running\.
+ The game server responds to requests to start a new game session\.

1. **Start GameLift Local\.**

   Open a command prompt window, navigate to the directory containing the file `GameLiftLocal.jar` and run it\. By default, Local listens for requests from game clients on port 8080\. To specify a different port number, use the `-p` parameter, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   java -jar GameLiftLocal.jar -p 9080
   ```

   Once Local starts, you see logs indicating that two local servers were started, one listening for your game server and one listening for your game client or the AWS CLI\. Logs continue to report activity on the two local servers, including communication to and from your game components\.

1. **Start your game server\.**

   Start your GameLift\-integrated game server locally\. You don't need to change the endpoint for the game server\. 

   In the Local command prompt window, log messages indicate that your game server has connected to the GameLift Local service\. This means that your game server successfully initialized the GameLift Server SDK \(with `InitSDK()`\)\. It has called `ProcessReady()` with the log paths shown and, if successful, is ready to host a game session\. While the game server is running, GameLift logs each health status report from the game server\. The following log messaging example shows a successfully integrated game server:

   ```
   16:50:53,217  INFO || - [SDKListenerImpl] nioEventLoopGroup-3-1 - SDK connected: /127.0.0.1:64247

   16:50:53,217  INFO || - [SDKListenerImpl] nioEventLoopGroup-3-1 - NOTE: Only SDK versions 3.1.5 and above are supported in GameLiftLocal!
   16:50:53,451  INFO || - [SDKListenerImpl] nioEventLoopGroup-3-1 - onProcessReady received from: /127.0.0.1:64247 and ackRequest requested? true

   16:50:53,558  INFO || - [SDKListenerImpl] nioEventLoopGroup-3-1 - onReportHealth received from /127.0.0.1:64247 with health status: healthy
   ```

   Potential error and warning messages include the following:
   + Error: "ProcessReady did not find a process with pID: *<process ID>*\! Was InitSDK\(\) invoked?"
   + Warning: "Process state already exists for process with pID: *<process ID>*\! Is ProcessReady\(\.\.\.\) invoked more than once?"

1. **Start the AWS CLI\.**

   Once your game server successfully calls `ProcessReady()`, you can start making client calls\. Open another command prompt window and start the AWS CLI tool\. [Get and install the AWS Command Line Interface tool\.](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) The AWS CLI by default uses the GameLift web service endpoint\. You must override this with the Local endpoint in every request using the `--endpoint-url` parameter, as shown in the following example request\.

   ```
   AWS gamelift describe-game-sessions --endpoint-url http://localhost:9080  --fleet-id fleet-123
   ```

   In the AWS CLI command prompt window, `AWS gamelift` commands result in responses as documented in the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift)\.

1. **Create a game session\.**

   With the AWS CLI, submit a [CreateGameSession\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateGameSession.html) request\. The request should follow the expected syntax\. For Local, the `FleetId` parameter can be set to any valid string \(`^fleet-\S+`\)\.

   ```
   AWS gamelift create-game-session --endpoint-url http://localhost:9080 --maximum-player-session-count 2 --fleet-id
       fleet-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d
   ```

   In the Local command prompt window, log messages indicate that GameLift Local has sent your game server an `onStartGameSession` callback\. If a game session is successfully created, your game server responds by invoking `ActivateGameSession`\.

   ```
   13:57:36,129  INFO || - [SDKInvokerImpl]
           Thread-2 - Finished sending event to game server to start a game session:

   ```

   In the AWS CLI window, GameLift responds with a game session object including a game session ID\. Notice that the new game session's status is Activating\. The status changes to Active once your game server invokes ActivateGameSession\. If you want to see the changed status , use the AWS CLI to call `DescribeGameSessions()`\.

   ```
   {
       "GameSession": {
         "Status": "ACTIVATING",
         "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 2,
         "FleetId": "fleet-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d",
         "GameSessionId": "arn:aws:gamelift:local::gamesession/fleet-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d/gsess-abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
         "IpAddress": "127.0.0.1",
         "Port": 1935
       }
   }
   ```

## Test a game server and client<a name="integration-testing-local-client"></a>

To check your full game integration, including connecting players to games, you can run both your game server and client locally\. This allows you to test programmatic calls from your game client to the GameLift Local\. You can verify the following actions: 
+ The game client is successfully making AWS SDK requests to the GameLift Local service, including to create game sessions, retrieve information on existing game sessions, and create player sessions\.
+ The game server is correctly validating players when they try to join a game session\. For validated players, the game server may retrieve player data \(if implemented\)\.
+ The game server reports a dropped connection when a player leaves the game\.
+ The game server reports ending a game session\.

1. **Start GameLift Local\.**

   Open a command prompt window, navigate to the directory containing the file `GameLiftLocal.jar` and run it\. By default, Local listens for requests from game clients on port 8080\. To specify a different port number, use the `-p` parameter, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   ./gamelift-local -p 9080
   ```

   Once Local starts, you see logs showing that two local servers were started, one listening for your game server and one listening for your game client or the AWS CLI\.

1. **Start your game server\.**

   Start your GameLift\-integrated game server locally\. See [Test a game server](#integration-testing-local-server) for more detail on message logs\.

1. **Configure your game client for Local and start it\.**

   To use your game client with the GameLift Local service, you must make the following changes to your game client's setup, as described in [Set up GameLift on a game client or backend service](gamelift-sdk-client-api.md#gamelift-sdk-client-api-initialize):
   + Change the `ClientConfiguration` object to point to your Local endpoint, such as `http://localhost:9080`\.
   + Set a target fleet ID value\. For Local, you do not need a real fleet ID; set the target fleet to any valid string \(`^fleet-\S+`\), such as `fleet-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d`\.
   + Set AWS credentials\. For Local, you do not need real AWS credentials; you can set the access key and secret key to any string\. 

   In the Local command prompt window, once you start the game client, log messages should indicate that it has initialized the `GameLiftClient` and is successfully communicated with the GameLift service\. 

1. **Test game client calls to the GameLift service\.**

   Verify that your game client is successfully making any or all of the following API calls:
   + [CreateGameSession\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateGameSession.html)
   + [DescribeGameSessions\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessions.html)
   + [CreatePlayerSession\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSession.html)
   + [CreatePlayerSessions\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSessions.html)
   + [DescribePlayerSessions\(\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribePlayerSessions.html)

   In the Local command prompt window, only calls to `CreateGameSession()` result in log messages\. Log messages show when GameLift Local prompts your game server to start a game session \(`onStartGameSession` callback\) and gets a successful `ActivateGameSession` when your game server invokes it\. In the AWS CLI window, all API calls result in responses or error messages as documented\. 

1. **Verify that your game server is validating new player connections\.**

   After creating a game session and a player session, establish a direct connection to the game session\.

   In the Local command prompt window, log messages should show that the game server has sent an `AcceptPlayerSession()` request to validate the new player connection\. If you use the AWS CLI to call `DescribePlayerSessions()`, the player session status should change from Reserved to Active\.

1. **Verify that your game server is reporting game and player status to the GameLift service\.**

   For GameLift to manage player demand and correctly report metrics, your game server must report various statuses back to GameLift\. Verify that Local is logging events related to following actions\. You may also want to use the AWS CLI to track status changes\.
   + **Player disconnects from a game session** – GameLift Local log messages should show that your game server calls `RemovePlayerSession()`\. An AWS CLI call to `DescribePlayerSessions()` should reflect a status change from `Active` to `Completed`\. You might also call `DescribeGameSessions()` to check that the game session's current player count decreases by one\.
   + **Game session ends** – GameLift Local log messages should show that your game server calls `TerminateGameSession()`\. 
**Note**  
Previous guidance was to call `TerminateGameSession()` when ending a game session\. This method is deprecated with GameLift Server SDK v4\.0\.1\. See [End a game session](gamelift-sdk-server-api.md#gamelift-sdk-server-shutdownsession)\. 
   + **Server process is terminated** – GameLift Local log messages should show that your game server calls `ProcessEnding()`\. An AWS CLI call to `DescribeGameSessions()` should reflect a status change from `Active` to `Terminated` \(or `Terminating`\)\.

## Variations with local<a name="integration-testing-local-special"></a>

When using GameLift Local, keep in mind the following:
+ Unlike the GameLift web service, Local does not track a server's health status and initiate the `onProcessTerminate` callback\. Local simply stops logging health reports for the game server\.
+ For calls to the AWS SDK, fleet IDs are not validated, and can be any string value that meets the parameter requirements \(`^fleet-\S+`\)\.
+ Game session IDs created with Local have a different structure\. They include the string `local`, as shown here:

  ```
  arn:aws:gamelift:local::gamesession/fleet-123/gsess-56961f8e-db9c-4173-97e7-270b82f0daa6
  ```
