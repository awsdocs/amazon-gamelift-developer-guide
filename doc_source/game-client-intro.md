# Add GameLift to an Amazon Lumberyard game client<a name="game-client-intro"></a>

All game clients must be configured to enable communication with the managed GameLift service, including specifics on which fleet to use, access credentials, how to connect, etc\. The simplest method is to create a batch file that sets the console variables listed as follows\.

**Tip**  
To learn more about GameLift features, including Realtime Servers, [try out the GameLift sample games](gamelift-explore.md)\.

**To prepare the game client**

1. In your batch file, set the following console variables to launch the game client\. These variables have been added to `\dev\Code\CryEngine\CryNetwork\Lobby\LobbyCvars`
   + `gamelift_aws_access_key` = part of the IAM [security credentials](setting-up-aws-login.md) for a user with "player" access in your AWS account 
   + `gamelift_aws_secret_key` = part of the IAM [security credentials](setting-up-aws-login.md) for a user with "player" access in your AWS account
   + `gamelift_fleet_id` = Unique ID of an active fleet to connect to
   + `gamelift_alias_id` = Unique ID of an alias pointing to a fleet to connect to
   + \(Optional\) `gamelift_endpoint` = GameLift server endpoint; the default value is `gamelift.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
   + \(Optional\) `gamelift_aws_region` = AWS region name; default value is `us-west-2`
   + \(Optional\) `gamelift_player_id` = ID that you generate to [uniquely identify a player](player-sessions-player-identifiers.md)

1. Add the following command to launch the server browser: 

   Follow this pattern when using a GameLift fleet ID \(`gamelift_fleet_id`\):

   ```
   .\Bin64\[your game executable] +gamelift_fleet_id [your fleet ID] +gamelift_aws_region us-west-2 +gamelift_aws_access_key [your AWS access key] +gamelift_aws_secret_key [your AWS secret key] +sv_port 64091 +map [map name]
   ```

   Follow this pattern when using a GameLift alias ID \(`gamelift_alias_id`\):

   ```
   .\Bin64\[your game executable] +gamelift_alias_id  [your alias ID] +gamelift_aws_region us-west-2 +gamelift_aws_access_key [your AWS access key] +gamelift_aws_secret_key [your AWS secret key] +sv_port 64091 +map [map name]
   ```
