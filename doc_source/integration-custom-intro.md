# Integrating games with custom game servers<a name="integration-custom-intro"></a>

Amazon GameLift provides a full tool set for preparing your multiplayer games and custom game servers to run on the managed GameLift service\. The GameLift SDKs contain libraries needed to enable game clients and servers to communicate with the GameLift service\. The SDKs can be downloaded directly; they are also included in the Amazon Lumberyard game engine\. For more details on the SDKs and where to get them, see [Download Amazon GameLift SDKs](gamelift-supported.md)\.

The topics in this section contain detailed instruction on how to add the necessary GameLift functionality to your game client and game server before deploying on GameLift\. For a complete roadmap to getting your game up and running on GameLift, see [Get started with custom servers](gamelift-integration.md)\.
