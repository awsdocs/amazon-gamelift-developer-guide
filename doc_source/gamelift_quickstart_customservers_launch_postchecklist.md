# Post\-launch phase checklist<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_launch_postchecklist"></a>

Use the following checklists to keep track of launch phase items\. Items marked **\[Critical\]** are critical for your production launch\. 
+  Tune scaling rules so that you are able to minimize idle capacity and, at the same time, supply all players with games\.
+  Measure the latency for your players and modify FlexMatch rules or roll\-out in additional Region locations based on your latency requirements\.
+  Optimize the server executable, as its performance efficiency has a direct effect on the fleet costs\. Increasing the number of server processes per instance allows you to run more game sessions with the same infrastructure\.
+  Use your analytics data to drive continued development, improving player experience and game longevity, and to optimize monetization\.
