+ [Tune scaling rules to minimize idle capacity\.](fleets-manage-capacity.md)
+ [Modify FlexMatch rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-intro.html) or [add additional locations](gamelift-compute.md#gamelift-compute-location) based on your latency requirements\.
+ Optimize the server executable, as its performance efficiency directly affects the fleet costs\. To run more game sessions with the same infrastructure, increase the number of server processes per instance\.
+ [Use your analytics data](monitoring-overview.md) to drive continued development, improve player experience and game longevity, and optimize monetization\.
