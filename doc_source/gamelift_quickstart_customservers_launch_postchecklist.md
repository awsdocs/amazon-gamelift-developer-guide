# Post\-launch<a name="gamelift_quickstart_customservers_launch_postchecklist"></a>

Use the following checklists to keep track of post\-launch items\.
+ Tune scaling rules so that you are able to minimize idle capacity\.
+ Measure the latency for your players and modify FlexMatch rules or add additional locations based on your latency requirements\.
+ Optimize the server executable, as its performance efficiency has a direct effect on the fleet costs\. Increasing the number of server processes per instance allows you to run more game sessions with the same infrastructure\.
+ Use your analytics data to drive continued development, improving player experience and game longevity, and to optimize monetization\.
