# Integrating a game client for Realtime Servers<a name="realtime-client"></a>

This topic describes how to prepare your game client to be able to join and participate in Amazon GameLift\-hosted game sessions\.

There are two sets of tasks needed to prepare your game client: 
+ Set up your game client to acquire information about existing games, request matchmaking, start new game sessions, and reserve game session slots for a player\. 
+ Enable your game client to join a game session hosted on a Realtime server and exchange messages\. 

## Find or create game sessions and player sessions<a name="realtime-client-start-gamesession"></a>

Set up your game client to find or start game sessions, request FlexMatch matchmaking, and reserve space for players in a game by creating player sessions\. As a best practice, create a backend service and use it to make the direct requests to the Amazon GameLift service when triggered by a game client action\. The backend service then relays relevant responses back to the game client\. 

1. Add the AWS SDK to your game client, initialize an Amazon GameLift client, and configure it to use the hosting resources in your fleets and queues\. The AWS SDK is available in several languages; see the Amazon GameLift SDKs [For client services](gamelift-supported.md#gamelift-supported-clients)\. 

1. Add GameLift functionality to your backend service\. For more detailed instructions, see [Add GameLift to your game client](gamelift-sdk-client-api.md) and [Adding FlexMatch matchmaking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-intro.html)\. The best practice is to use game session placements to create new game sessions\. This method lets you take full advantage of GameLift's ability to quickly and intelligently place new game sessions, as well as use player latency data to minimize game lag\. At a minimum, your backend service must be able to request new game sessions and handle game session data in response\. You may also want to add functionality to search for and get information on existing game sessions, and request player sessions, which effectively reserve a player slot in an existing game session\.

1. Convey connection information back to the game client\. The backend service receives game session and player session objects in response to requests to the Amazon GameLift service\. These objects contain information, in particular connection details \(IP address and port\) and player session ID, that the game client needs to connect to the game session running on a Realtime Server\. 

## Connect to games on Realtime Servers<a name="realtime-client-connect"></a>

Enable your game client to connect directly with a hosted game session on a Realtime server and exchange messages with the server and with other players\.

1. Get the Realtime Client SDK, build it, and add it to your game client project\. See the README file for more information on SDK requirements and instructions on how to build the client libraries\. 

1. Call [Client\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-client) with a client configuration that specifies the type of client/server connection to use\.
**Note**  
If you're connecting to a Realtime server that is running on a secured fleet with a TLS certificate, you must specify a secured connection type\.

1. Add the following functionality to your game client\. See the [Realtime Servers client API \(C\#\) reference](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref.md) for more information\. 
   + Connect to and disconnect from a game 
     + [Connect\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-connect)
     + [Disconnect\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-disconnect)
   + Send messages to target recipients 
     + [SendMessage\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-sendmessage)
   + Receive and process messages 
     + [OnDataReceived\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-callbacks.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-callbacks-ondata)
   + Join groups and leave player groups 
     + [JoinGroup\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-joingroup)
     + [RequestGroupMembership\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-requestgroupmembership)
     + [LeaveGroup\(\)](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions.md#realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-actions-leavegroup)

1. Set up event handlers for the client callbacks as needed\. See [Realtime Servers client API \(C\#\) reference: Asynchronous callbacks](realtime-sdk-csharp-ref-callbacks.md)\.

When working with Realtime fleets that have TLS certificate generation enabled, the server is automatically authenticated using the TLS certificate\. TCP and UDP traffic is encrypted in flight to provide transport layer security\. TCP traffic is encrypted using TLS 1\.2, and UDP traffic is encrypted using DTLS 1\.2\.

## Game client examples<a name="realtime-client-examples"></a>

### Basic realtime client \(C\#\)<a name="realtime-client-examples-basic"></a>

This example illustrates a basic game client integration with the Realtime Client SDK \(C\#\)\. As shown, the example initializes a Realtime client object, sets up event handlers and implements the client\-side callbacks, connects to a Realtime server, sends a message, and disconnects\.

using System.Text;
using Aws.GameLift.Realtime;
using Aws.GameLift.Realtime.Event;
using Aws.GameLift.Realtime.Types;
