# Setting up AWS billing alerts<a name="gamelift-billing-alerts"></a>

You may want to set up and configure a billing alert to notify you of billing events\. For more information, see [Creating a Billing Alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-alarms.html)\.

In addition to receiving billing alerts, you can view your current estimated bill for GameLift on the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)\. This will help you review your resource consumption, make decisions about future usage, and determine your scaling needs\.

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, you may want to [scale down your fleet](fleets-updating-capacity.md) when not in use\.
