# Game architecture with Realtime Servers<a name="realtime-architecture"></a>

The diagram shown below illustrates the key components of a game architecture that is hosted using the managed GameLift with Realtime Servers solution\.

Key components are defined as follows:

Game clients  
To join a game being hosted on GameLift, your game client must first find an available game session\. The game client searches for existing game sessions, requests matchmaking, or starts a new game session by communicating with GameLift service\. This communication is done through a backend client service in order to help game owners maintain secure control of their game servers and hosting resources\. The client service makes requests to the GameLift service and in response receives game session information, including connection details, which the client service relays back to the game client\. The game client then uses this information, with the Realtime Client SDK, to connect directly to the game server\. Once connected, the game client can join the game and exchange game state updates with other players in the game\. The green arrow represents the direct connection between game client and game server during gameplay\.

Client services  
A backend client service handles communication between game clients and the GameLift service by calling the GameLift service APIs in the AWS SDK\. Client services might also be used for other game\-specific tasks such as player authentication and authorization, inventory, or currency control\. For example, when a player joins a game, your game client might first call an authentication client service to verify the player's identity, and only then send a game session request to the GameLift service\. Relevant information that the client service receives from the GameLift service, such as connection details, are relayed back to the game client\.

External services  
Your game may rely on an external service, such as for validating a subscription membership\. As shown in the architecture diagram, information from an external service can be passed to your game servers \(via a client service and the GameLift service\) without going through the game client\.

Realtime Servers  
To host game sessions, you create a Realtime Servers fleet that is configured for your game\. The Realtime servers takes the place of an integrated full\-fledged game server; instead they run script, which you customize for your game and upload to GameLift\. Realtime servers track player connections to a game session and relay game data between players to keep each player's game state in sync\. They also communicate with the GameLift service to start new game sessions, validate newly connected players, and report on the status of game sessions, player connections, and available resources\. When joining a game, a game client connects directly to a Realtime server after receiving connection details from the GameLift service\.

GameLift service  
The GameLift service is the core service that deploys and manages fleets of resources to host your Realtime servers, coordinates how game sessions are placed across your available resources, starts and stops game sessions, and tracks game server health and activity in order to maintain game availability as player traffic fluctuates\. When setting up and managing hosting resources, game owners use the GameLift service APIs in the AWS SDK and CLI to upload game server builds and scripts, create and configure fleets, and manage fleet capacity\. Client services start new game sessions, request matchmaking, and slot players into game sessions by calling the GameLift service APIs in the AWS SDK\. 

Hosting management tools  
The GameLift tool set in the AWS SDK provides multiple ways for you to configure your game hosting resources, scale capacity to player demand, and monitor the current status of resources, as well as track metrics on game server performance and game and player activity\. In addition, you can remotely access any individual game server for troubleshooting\.
